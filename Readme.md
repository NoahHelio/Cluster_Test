# Getting Started

Run locally with docker compose:
```
$ docker compose up --build
# 
# LOTS of text as docker pulls the images and 
# builds the next steps, and then launches the 
# containers.  Finally you'll see...
cluster_test-service_demo-1  |  * Debugger PIN: 642-840-851

# Next, get the ingress service's port from docker ps
$ docker ps

```

Then visit http://localhost:[PORT]/ (The port is 49161 in this example) in your browser to visit the ingress pod and test db, service, and service-to-db connections. 

The ingress pod serves a page like this:   
>     
>  Ingress pod is reachable and responsive!   
>     
>  Other links:   
>  _Service connection_   
>  _Database connection_    
>  _Test service db connection_ (these are clickable links when served)
